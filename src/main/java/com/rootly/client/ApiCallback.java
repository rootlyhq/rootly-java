/*
 * Rootly API v1
 * # How to generate an API Key? - **Organization dropdown** > **Organization Settings** > **API Keys**  # JSON:API Specification Rootly is using **JSON:API** (https://jsonapi.org) specification: - JSON:API is a specification for how a client should request that resources be fetched or modified, and how a server should respond to those requests. - JSON:API is designed to minimize both the number of requests and the amount of data transmitted between clients and servers. This efficiency is achieved without compromising readability, flexibility, or discoverability. - JSON:API requires use of the JSON:API media type (**application/vnd.api+json**) for exchanging data.  # Authentication and Requests We use standard HTTP Authentication over HTTPS to authorize your requests. ```   curl --request GET \\ --header 'Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json' \\ --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN' \\ --url https://api.rootly.com/v1/incidents ```  <br/>  # Rate limiting - There is a default limit of approximately **3000** **GET** calls **per API key** every **60 seconds**. The limit is calculated over a **60-second sliding window** looking back from the current time. While the limit can be configured to support higher thresholds, you must first contact your **Rootly Customer Success Manager** to make any adjustments. - There is a default limit of approximately **3000** **PUT**, **POST**, **PATCH** or **DELETE** calls **per API key** every **60 seconds**. The limit is calculated over a **60-second sliding window** looking back from the current time. While the limit can be configured to support higher thresholds, you must first contact your **Rootly Customer Success Manager** to make any adjustments. - The response to the API call will return 429 HTTP status code - Request Limit Exceeded and Rootly will not ingest the event. - Additional headers will be returned giving you information about the limit:   - **RateLimit-Limit** - The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make.   - **RateLimit-Remaining** - The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.   - **RateLimit-Reset** - The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds.  # Pagination - Pagination is supported for all endpoints that return a collection of items. - Pagination is controlled by the **page** query parameter  ## Example ```   curl --request GET \\ --header 'Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json' \\ --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN' \\ --url https://api.rootly.com/v1/incidents?page[number]=1&page[size]=10 ```
